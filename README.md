# ONLINE MENTORING PROGRAM PLATFORM

## CLIENT - ANU FIFTY50

Our client ANU Fifty50 is a student-run organisation promoting gender equity in STEM. Their vision is to have an equitable STEM pipeline from university to industry and academia, inclusive of all students, regardless of their gender.

The project is to build an Online Mentoring Platform in the form of a website. The intent is to replace the current Wattle platform used by Fifty50. The platform automates the current mentoring program. Younger students (mentees) are paired with older students (mentors), which leads to the formation of inter-year networks. The program is different from other mentoring programs around as it has targeted content and forces the users to be reflective. Users can signup to the platform anytime. Once there is a match, a mentoring relationship is started. Content is released fortnightly and mentees and mentors can meet each other either in person or online.

#### CLIENT EXPECTATIONS
1. In terms of the website, the client expectations are a functioning prototype by the end of Semester 1, 2017 and a tested version ready for release at the end of Semester 2, 2017.
2. The client expects the team to communicate constantly through Slack and regular meetings.
3. The client is happy with the progress so far and understands why the MVP (Minimal Viable Product) has been delayed. They are also happy that the team has taken user feedback into account.

#### HOW OUR PROJECT IS MAKING THINGS BETTER FOR THE CLIENT?
The Online Mentoring Platform automates the mentoring program for our client. Currently, the mentoring program uses Wattle and Google Docs for management. There is an administrative overhead with this as everything has to be done manually. This also limits the program to be just at the ANU. Through the platform, the overhead is reduced and it also gives rise to the possibility of expansion to other universities.  

#### TOOLS USED
1. Github for source code and version control.
2. Slack for team and client communication.
3. Google Drive for file management.
4. Trello for project management and organisation.
5. Python and Django for backend development.
6. HTML, CSS and JavaScript for frontend development.

#### HOW TO RUN THE PROJECT
Change directory to project and follow the instructions:

#### PROJECT MILESTONES

#### RESOURCES
The client ANU Fifty50 is providing the team with required resources such as design documents for the website, content to upload etc.

#### POTENTIAL COSTS
The only cost will be associated with hosting the website on a server. The team is acquiring free hosting from Python Anywhere for a year and after that, the client is going to cover those costs.
