# ONLINE MENTORING PROGRAM PLATFORM

## CLIENT - ANU FIFTY50

Our client ANU Fifty50 is a student-run organisation promoting gender equity in STEM. Their vision is to have an equitable STEM pipeline from university to industry and academia, inclusive of all students, regardless of their gender.

The project is to build an Online Mentoring Platform in the form of a website. The intent is to replace the current Wattle platform used by Fifty50. The platform automates the current mentoring program. Younger students (mentees) are paired with older students (mentors), which leads to the formation of inter-year networks. The program is different from other mentoring programs around as it has targeted content and forces the users to be reflective. Users can signup to the platform anytime. Once there is a match, a mentoring relationship is started. Content is released fortnightly and mentees and mentors can meet each other either in person or online.

#### CLIENT EXPECTATIONS
1. In terms of the website, the client expectations are a functioning prototype by the end of Semester 1, 2017 and a tested version ready for release at the end of Semester 2, 2017.
2. The client expects the team to communicate constantly through Slack and regular meetings.
3. The client is happy with the progress so far and understands why the MVP (Minimal Viable Product) has been delayed. They are also happy that the team has taken user feedback into account.

#### HOW OUR PROJECT IS MAKING THINGS BETTER FOR THE CLIENT?
The Online Mentoring Platform automates the mentoring program for our client. Currently, the mentoring program uses Wattle and Google Docs for management. There is an administrative overhead with this as everything has to be done manually. This also limits the program to be just at the ANU. Through the platform, the overhead is reduced and it also gives rise to the possibility of expansion to other universities.  

### VALUE DELIVERED TO OUR CLIENT SINCE THE LAST PROJECT AUDIT
1. Since the last project audit, we have been able to deploy our website so it is ready as soon as we are able to train our Client into how the website works and how to use it. This means they can take control, start a test Mentoring Program in which they can have a few mentees, mentors and admins to control the site within their committee and give us any feedback using our GitHub Issues page. 
2. We have fixed some pairing issues in which it didn't show admins who is paired with who, and if they are a mentor or not. This makes it much easier for admins to see now as they can find out exactly who is paired with who and if they are a mentor or mentee. 
3. During week 4 we held a user testing session in which we got useful feedback from the users of our website. This feedback showed us how our users actually use our site and if they use it the way we intended for them to use it. Logs of the different issues we found were taken down and added to our GitHub issues page. Our team has been working on fixing these issues over time. 

### EFFECTIVE AND APPROPRIATE DECISION MAKING
Our last project audit gave insight into how we log the decisions we make. We have now created a Decision Paper document in which it encompasses all the decisions we have made since Week 1 of Semester 2. This decision paper helps us keep a track of all the important decisions we have made such as choosing to open source our project and delivering the minimal viable product to our client. 

#### TOOLS USED
1. Github for source code and version control.
2. Slack for team and client communication.
3. Google Drive for file management.
4. Trello for project management and organisation.

#### RESOURCES
The client ANU Fifty50 is providing the team with required resources such as design documents for the website, content to upload etc.
